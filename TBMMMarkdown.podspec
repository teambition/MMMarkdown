  MMMarkdown is an Objective-C framework for converting Markdown to HTML. It is compatible with OS X 10.7+, iOS 8.0+, tvOS, and watchOS.

  Unlike other Markdown libraries, MMMarkdown implements an actual parser. It is not a port of the original Perl implementation and does not use regular expressions to transform the input into HTML. MMMarkdown tries to be efficient and minimize memory usage.
